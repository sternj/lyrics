All the days blend together
the evenings and mornings
I have not been at home in my head in 3 weeks

I've felt under the weather 
since the end of september
despite what they tell me 
the future looks bleak

For what am I yearning?
I never have known 
the norm of the place where, in theory, I am

This liminal space
is a slap in the face
but still I'm aware
how much worse it could be 

Yet I can't express
all the things that I'm feeling
in meter more complex 
than children could write

my rhymes may be lacking 
but I will continue
to sing compound duple
and scream to the void

It's hard to have feeling
in the unyielding monotony
of the present day-- 
not that you need

yet another lament of our
pandemic state 
when everyone sits on their hands
and just waits

Not to be hypocritical,
it's not like I'll do anything
to improve
my own station in life

but bitching with guitars
is more interesting than laying in bed
I guess that perhaps it's a start?
